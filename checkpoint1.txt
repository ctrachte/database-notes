Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
- SQL is declaritive meaning you describe a result and get the answer back from the database engine
- Other languages are primarily procedural, or imperative, meaning you describe the path via an algorithm to find the exact item.

In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

- a row represents a set of values for each column label.
- a column is a specific type of data stored in the table, such as "price"
- a value is a piece of data stored in a cell of a table, at unique intersection of a row/column.
