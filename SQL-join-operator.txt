How do you find related data held in two separate data tables?
- by using a JOIN command

Explain, in your own words, the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Give a real-world example for each.
- INNER JOIN merges combines data from two tables only where  the conditions are met for each row.
 - Example: We have a table of sold inventory and a table of in-stock inventory and we want to see sales compared to inventory for the week.
- LEFT OUTER JOIN - merges data from two tables, a left and right table, and wherever a row from the right table does not meet the conditions, a blank row is added to the results to ensure all rows from the left table are represented.
 - Example: A cell phone company has a table for data usage by user and monthly payments by user. They want to pull all data usage to payments regardless of whether or not the user has paid.
- RIGHT OUTER JOIN - the opposite of the LEFT OUTER JOIN
 - Example: The cell phone company wants to pull all payments by user and compare to their data usage regardless of whether or not the user has used any of their allotted data.


Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real-world example for each.
- A primary key is a unique key that exists only once per row in a table. It allows indexing and identification of that row.
- A foreign key is simply a key in another table that allows comparison of the two tables by matching the two keys. 
- Example: In our cell phone company example, the user ID in the data usage table could be the primary key, and the user id in the payments table could be the foreign key.

Define aliasing.
- aliasing is when you abbreviate column or row names using the first letter of each name. It makes querying data faster.

Change this query so that you are using aliasing:

SELECT p.name, c.salary, c.vacation_days
 FROM professor AS p
 JOIN compensation AS c
 ON p.id = c.professor_id;


Why would you use a NATURAL JOIN? Give a real-world example.
