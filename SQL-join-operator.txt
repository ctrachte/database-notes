How do you find related data held in two separate data tables?
- by using a JOIN command

Explain, in your own words, the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Give a real-world example for each.
- INNER JOIN merges combines data from two tables only where  the conditions are met for each row.
 - Example: We have a table of sold inventory and a table of in-stock inventory and we want to see sales compared to inventory for the week.
- LEFT OUTER JOIN - merges data from two tables, a left and right table, and wherever a row from the right table does not meet the conditions, a NULL row is added to the results to ensure all rows from the left table are represented.
 - Example: A cell phone company has a table for data usage by user and monthly payments by user. They want to pull all data usage to payments regardless of whether or not the user has paid.
- RIGHT OUTER JOIN - the opposite of the LEFT OUTER JOIN
 - Example: The cell phone company wants to pull all payments by user and compare to their data usage regardless of whether or not the user has used any of their allotted data.


Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real-world example for each.
- A primary key is a unique key that exists only once per row in a table. It allows indexing and identification of that row.
- A foreign key is simply a key in another table that allows comparison of the two tables by matching the two keys. 
- Example: In our cell phone company example, the user ID in the data usage table could be the primary key, and the user id in the payments table could be the foreign key.

Define aliasing.
- aliasing is when you abbreviate column or row names using the first letter of each name. It makes querying data faster.

Change this query so that you are using aliasing:

SELECT p.name, c.salary, c.vacation_days
 FROM professor AS p
 JOIN compensation AS c
 ON p.id = c.professor_id;


Why would you use a NATURAL JOIN? Give a real-world example.
- NATURAL JOIN is a more convenient way of writing an INNER JOIN when you only want to merge shared columns from two tables.
- Example: We have a table of library books by ID and a table of each damaged books repair status. We want to see all books repair status by title. A NATURAL JOIN would allow us to compare all book titles by repair status.


Using this Employee schema and data, write queries to find the following information:

List all employees and all shifts.

SELECT *
 FROM scheduled_shifts AS ss
 JOIN shifts AS s 
  ON ss.shift_id = s.id
 JOIN employees AS e
  ON ss.employee_id = e.id;

Using this Adoption schema and data, please write queries to retrieve the following information and include the results:

Create a list of all volunteers. If the volunteer is fostering a dog, include each dog as well.

SELECT v.first_name, v.last_name, d.name
 FROM volunteers AS v
 LEFT OUTER JOIN dogs AS d
 ON v.foster_dog_id = d.id;

The cat's name, adopter's name, and adopted date for each cat adopted within the past month to be displayed as part of the "Happy Tail" social media promotion which posts recent successful adoptions.

SELECT c.name, ca.date, a.first_name, a.last_name
 FROM cat_adoptions AS ca
 JOIN adopters AS a
  ON a.id = ca.adopter_id
 JOIN cats AS c
  ON c.id = ca.cat_id
 WHERE ca.date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 DAYS';

Create a list of adopters who have not yet chosen a dog to adopt.

SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
 FROM adopters AS a
 JOIN dog_adoptions AS da
  ON a.id != da.adopter_id;

Lists of all cats and all dogs who have not been adopted.

SELECT c.name
 FROM cats AS c
 LEFT OUTER JOIN cat_adoptions AS ca
  ON c.id = ca.cat_id
 WHERE ca.cat_id IS NULL;
 
SELECT d.name
 FROM dogs AS d
 LEFT OUTER JOIN dog_adoptions AS da
  ON d.id = da.dog_id
 WHERE da.dog_id IS NULL;

The name of the person who adopted Rosco.

SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
 FROM adopters AS a
 JOIN dog_adoptions AS da
  ON a.id = da.adopter_id;

Using this Library schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios and include the results:

To determine if the library should buy more copies of a given book, please provide the names and position, in order, of all of the patrons with a hold (request for a book with all copies checked out) on "Advanced Potion-Making".

SELECT h.rank, p.name
 FROM holds AS h
 JOIN patrons AS p
  ON h.patron_id = p.id
 WHERE h.isbn = '9136884926'
 ORDER BY h.rank;

List all of the library patrons. If they have one or more books checked out, list the books with the patrons.

SELECT p.name, b.title
 FROM patrons AS p
 LEFT OUTER JOIN transactions AS t
  ON p.id = t.patron_id AND t.checked_in_date IS NULL
 LEFT OUTER JOIN books AS b
  ON b.isbn = t.isbn;
